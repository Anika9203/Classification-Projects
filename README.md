# Data Analysis-Projects

## Data Analysis Projects Repository
Welcome to my data analysis projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I've worked on, focusing on data analysis in various domains. Below is a brief overview of the projects included:

Projects Overview
### Email Spam Detection
Utilized machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or not spam.
Implemented algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.

### Lane Detection using Computer Vision
Developed a computer vision-based system to detect lane markings on roads.
Utilized techniques like edge detection, Hough transforms, and image processing to identify lanes.

### Restaurant Dataset Analysis
Analyzed a dataset containing information about restaurants, including ratings, cuisines, and locations.
Explored trends such as popular cuisines, average ratings, and geographical distribution of restaurants.

### Terrorism Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about terrorist incidents.
Investigated trends in terrorism over time, geographical hotspots, and types of attacks.

### Water Quality Analysis
Analyzed a dataset containing measurements of water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.
Explored correlations between different water quality parameters and identified potential pollution sources.
